## 👋 Hello, I'm Xi Chen (陈希)

I am currently a **Master of Science in Computer Science** student at **Johns Hopkins University**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Temporal Data Forecasting** and **Natural Language Process**. 

With a solid foundation in ML algorithms and hands-on experience in full-stack data visualization, I am committed to pursuing an academic career path and seeking research mentorship to bridge the gap toward a **PhD program**.
